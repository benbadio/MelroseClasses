## About the Melrose Center
Central Florida is a center of creativity and technology. Libraries are centers for learning. The Orange County Library System believes that we can use our experience as providers of informal learning and technology education to provide  services for community members to gain the understanding required to be both contributor to, developer for and consumer of today’s emerging technologies.

Through a generous gift from the Kendrick B. Melrose Family Foundation, the Library created the [Dorothy Lumley Melrose Center for Technology, Innovation and Creativity](http://tic.ocls.info). Named for Mr. Melrose’s mother who had a strong interest in emerging technologies, the Center is located in 26,000 sq. ft. of space on the Orlando Public Library’s second floor.

In pursuit of our “lifelong learner” role, the Library already offers over 1,000 classes per month across 15 locations. Recognized by the American Library Association as a “Library of the Future”, this program consists of nearly 200 unique curricula ranging from Introduction to Mouse and Keyboard to Creating Web Pages in HTML 5. Some of today’s top software packages are offered, such as QuickBooks, Microsoft Office and the Adobe Creative Cloud Complete.  Open source packages, such as Audacity and Gimp are also offered. Live Online Learning and recorded tutorials are available via the Web. Outside of the technology arena, a range of children’s programs supporting early learning and programs for adults are offered to expose and introduce topics of interest from opening your own food truck, to CPR, and self-publishing your own eBook.

The Dorothy Lumley Melrose Center expands the role of the library. Building upon the very practical training that is currently offered, the Center offers access to hardware, equipment, software, support and programming to inspire and invigorate creativity and accomplishment.
